              <ul>
                <li>If you do not have the legal capacity to file a report, your legal representative can do it for you.</li>
                <li>Ideally you should file the report as soon as possible, whether you know who the perpetrator was or not</li>
                <li>You can only file a criminal complaint if you are the actual victim of a crime.</li>
                <li>You must file the complaint within three months of the incident.</li>
                <li>You can make the complaint against a specific person or persons or against persons unknown.</li>
                <li>You can withdraw the complaint. But remember: if you have been injured or sustained a loss or damage due to the crime, and you want to claim for this as part of the criminal proceedings</li>
                <li>You don't have to have a lawyer. But in complicated cases, it is advisable to consult one.</li>
                <li>You can file a criminal complaint at any police station, either verbally or in writing or you can file a written complaint with the public prosecutor.</li>
